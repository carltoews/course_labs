    "One of the metaphors we introduced to talk about hypothesis testing was the \"innocent  until proven guilty\" one.  Specifically, we assume that a parameter has a particular value, and stick to this assumption unless there is strong evidence against it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have seen this paradigm at work in the setting of **means**, **proportions**, **differences of means**, and **differences of proportions.**  In all four cases, the evidence we gathered consists of a single number, a *point estimate* (calculated from a sample.) If the point estimate is close to the assumed value of the statistic, we \"do nothing\" (i.e. assume the null is *innocenct*), but if it's far away, we \"reject the null\" (i.e. *convict* the null of being wrong.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to extend this basic paradigm to the setting of categorical data involving two or more categories.  Here it will turn out that the \"evidence\" is not a direct estimate of a parameter value, but rather a composite score which takes on the value of 0 if the data exactly reflects the null hypothesis, and grows as the data deviates from that hypothesis.\n",
